Hey nerds. This is the guide that’ll show you how to use my AMAZING program.

TIPS FOR USE- 
Don’t rely on this thing to calculate sig figs, I never programmed that in.
Some things are broken because they’re unfinished, but I’m pretty sure it’s just one or two coordinate plane tools, so whatever.
If you screw up input, start over by hitting (not command(cmd), CTRL(CONTROL)) CTRL+c and redoing the
	python HardMathSim2016.py
command
Disregard any .0s on the ends of final answers and work and the like. It’s a byproduct of the calculations I can’t be bothered to remove. If anyone wants to help me with that feel free.
If you have any issues, please email me at (you’re gonna hate this) starwolf1237@gmail.com
I will probably add to this as more content is assigned to us, so check back as the year goes on. If there’s a new version (I’ll announce on Twitter @W_Nilges) you should just reinstall.

INSTALLATION - 
Download DarkAlgae.app.zip
Unzip DarkAlgae.app.zip
In the unzipped folder, there will be DarkAlgae.app.
Drag the app to your Applications folder.
To run, click it! You can drag it to your dock too. If it says it won’t open due to unidentified developer, right click on it (CTRL + Click) and open it.
Done! When I release updates, all you’ll have to do is repeat the process.

If you experience any weird errors such as

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/williamnilges/OneDrive/Code/HardMathSim2016.py", line 27, in <module>
    Begin = input ("> ")
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'chicken' is not defined

Don’t worry, just restart the program and don’t try to use ‘chicken’ as a number.
I just wish someone would end my suffering.

# Hard-Math-Simulator
A python script for solving complex math. With formulas.

Hard Math Simulator - A hideous monolithic tool used to compute stuff that I find difficult to do. I mostly use it to do repetitive problems and/or figure out hard math. Hence the name.

TIPS FOR USE- 
Don’t rely on this thing to calculate sig figs, I never programmed that in.
Some things are broken because they’re unfinished, but I’m pretty sure it’s just one or two coordinate plane tools, so whatever.

Disregard any .0s on the ends of final answers and work and the like. It’s a byproduct of the calculations I can’t be bothered to remove. If anyone wants to help me with that feel free.

INSTALLATION -
Download and run HardMathSim2017.py

Have fun!

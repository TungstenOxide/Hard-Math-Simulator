# Hard-Math-Simulator
A python script for solving complex math. With formulas.

Hard Math Simulator - A hideous monolithic tool used to compute stuff that I find difficult to do. I mostly use it to do repetitive problems and/or figure out hard math. Hence the name.

TIPS FOR USE- 
Don’t rely on this thing to calculate sig figs, I never programmed that in.
Some things are broken because they’re unfinished, but I’m pretty sure it’s just one or two coordinate plane tools, so whatever.

***INSTRUCTIONS***

If you screw up input, start over by hitting (not command(cmd), CTRL(CONTROL)) CTRL+c and redoing the

	```python HardMathSim2016.py```

command

Disregard any .0s on the ends of final answers and work and the like. It’s a byproduct of the calculations I can’t be bothered to remove. If anyone wants to help me with that feel free.

If you have any issues, please email me at will.nilges@gmail.com
I might add to this as more content is assigned to me in my various math classes, so check back as the year goes on. If there’s a new version (I’ll announce on Twitter @W_Nilges) you should just reinstall.

INSTALLATION -
Download and run HardMathSim2017.py

If you experience any weird errors such as

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/williamnilges/OneDrive/Code/HardMathSim2016.py", line 27, in <module>
    Begin = input ("> ")
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'chicken' is not defined

Don’t worry, just restart the program and don’t try to use ‘chicken’ as a number.

Have fun!
